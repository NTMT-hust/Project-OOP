## Getting Started

Please download the sentiment model here: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qSo4s3jF9AsiCDm_zRClddvRCx7UPU5E/view?usp=drive_link`
Extract the model at `Project-OOP/src/resources/visobert`
Remember to extract only the `.zip` file contents

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
