## Folder Structure



The workspace contains two folders by default, where:



- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies



Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.



> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
